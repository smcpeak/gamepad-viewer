elden-ring-dead-zones.txt

This file has my notes on where the Elden Ring dead zones are.


Triggers
--------

Both activate at exactly 128.


Right stick
-----------

Dead zone is a square with radius ~6600.

Camera speed seems continuous after that, but didn't really carefully
test.


Left stick
----------

The dead zone is approximately an octagon with corners at 16k/8k.

After that, exceeding 25.5k in one axis or 20k/20k in both crosses from
walk to run.  Seems close to circular.

After that, exceeding 30k in one axis or 23k/23k in both crosses to the
region where Torrent will keep galloping.  Seems close to circular.
